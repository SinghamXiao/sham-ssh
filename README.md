# sham.software Mock SFTP API

Mock SFTP testing library for running an SFTP server in process, using a local temporary directory

This library is still under development. Feel free to use, contribute but there could be changes to
the API until it reaches 1.0 status. Of course, we'll try to keep breaking changes to a minimum.
